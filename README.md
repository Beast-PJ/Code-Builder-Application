# Code Builder

Code Builder is a revolutionary application designed to transform how you build and understand code. With its drag-and-drop interface, real-time flowcharts, and algorithm generation, Code Builder makes programming accessible and enjoyable. Currently supporting the C language, it is set to expand to include multiple programming languages, making it an invaluable tool for education, practice, and more.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Construct code easily with a visual drag-and-drop interface, eliminating the need for manual coding and reducing errors.
- **Real-Time Flowcharts:** Generate dynamic flowcharts that reflect changes in your code in real-time, providing a clear visual representation of your logic.
- **Algorithm Generation:** Instantly generate algorithms based on the code you build, aiding in understanding and optimization.
- **C Language Support:** Start with C language support, with future plans to incorporate a variety of programming languages.
- **Interactive Tutorials:** Access built-in interactive tutorials and guides that walk you through programming concepts and how to use Code Builder effectively.
- **Custom Code Blocks:** Create and save custom code blocks for reuse in different projects, enhancing productivity.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Enjoy syntax highlighting in the code blocks to make reading and debugging code easier.
- **Integrated Code Editor:** Use an integrated code editor for more advanced coding needs and direct coding without leaving the application.
- **Version Control Integration:** Connect with version control systems like Git to manage your code versions and collaborate with others.
- **Code Export:** Export your code, flowcharts, and algorithms in various formats (e.g., PDF, PNG) for documentation and presentation.
